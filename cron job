#INSTALLING CRON
sudo apt install cron

#After installing, you can start and enable the cron service using:
sudo systemctl start cron
sudo systemctl enable cron

Once cron is installed, you can use crontab -e to set up your cron jobs.
Open the crontab file:
crontab -e
Add the following cron job to run your script every minute:
* * * * * /home/ubuntu/script.sh > /home/ubuntu/script_output.log 2>&1
Save and exit the editor.
This will execute script.sh every minute and redirect both standard output and errors to script_output.log.

*/2 * * * * /home/ubuntu/script.sh > /home/ubuntu/script_output.log 2>&1
This configuration will run your script (script.sh) every 2 minutes and log the output to script_output.log.
The command */2 * * * * /home/ubuntu/script.sh > /home/ubuntu/my_log_file.log 2>&1 does the following:

Schedules the script: It runs /home/ubuntu/script.sh every two minutes.
Redirects output: Standard output (stdout) is written to my_log_file.log.
Captures errors: Standard error (stderr) is also redirected to the same log file, combining both output and error messages in one place.
This setup helps you track both normal and error outputs from your script.
With 2>&1: Both standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) go to the same log file. This means youâ€™ll capture all messages, including errors.
Without 2>&1: Only standard output will be logged. Standard error messages will not appear in your log file, making it harder to diagnose issues 
if the script fails.
